Added a pull timer broadcast so that when the timer is started it is also sent to the group. Party and raid members now receive the countdown and start their timer at the same time.

Added a new sync message (L30_PULL) with a handler that starts the pull timer on recipients only when the instance and dungeon are supported and no timer is already running.

Improved the help text for /l30 key by showing the expected argument in the usage line.

Note : Existing mob, boss, and death sync logic is unchanged.

Fixed boss tracking and completion logic in Freehold. The completion screen now only appears when both all bosses are defeated and the mob threshold is reached. Minor adjustments in Settings and Timer UI to reflect these fixes.

Prepared the addon for tournament use. Set and verified the correct mob and boss counts to ensure runs validate properly in supported dungeons.

Published the initial 1.0.0 release notes and documentation. Added a README describing features, installation, usage, the encrypted export format, and a table of slash commands with screenshot placeholders.

Created a versioning template to standardize future release entries.

Improved the minimap button behavior so it anchors cleanly to the minimap edge.

Corrected minimap button icon alignment so the icon is centered within the button.

Fixed double-counting of party deaths by removing an extra network increment. Deaths are now counted locally and synced correctly across the group.

Added an encrypted run export system using RC4. Users can export run data as a compact encrypted string that can be shared and later decoded for analytics.

Major overhaul of the Legacy30 dungeon timer. Added real-time mob and boss tracking, party synchronization for kills, boss defeats, and deaths, draggable/lockable UI frames, a comprehensive slash command set, and a redesigned completion screen with portraits and victory sound. Cleaned up events, networking, and naming, and added safety checks throughout.

Added a temporary test path to validate boss defeat detection in live runs.

Corrected the victory sound played on run completion and routed it to the master channel.

Ensured mob and boss counters update reliably, added clearer status messages, and tightened the start/stop sequencing so progress and completion rules are enforced consistently.

Fixed SetFont calls in the export window by adding the required flags parameter for compatibility with the current client.

Refreshed the working file set and instructions. Marked which files need replacement, and reorganized UI code so fonts are set before text assignments.

Updated core structures and item database scaffolding to support the new timer and export features.

2025-10-07
Updated default settings and dungeon configuration thresholds.

Initial repository setup.
